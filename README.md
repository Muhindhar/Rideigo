# 🚗 Rideigo — Ride Sharing / Cab Booking (HTML only)

**Rideigo** is a lightweight, HTML/CSS/JavaScript prototype for a ride-sharing UI.  
This version is a static, front-end only project (no backend). The app demonstrates core UI flows — users click vehicle icons (car, bike, auto, etc.) to go to the corresponding vehicle page (for example: clicking the car navigates to `red_taxi.html`).
